# Lethal-Hotkeys
Lethal Hotkeys is a lightweight script that gives the player macros that help with utility and quality of life. Macros only run when in Lethal Company.
## Update
I will be remaking Lethal Hotkeys from scratch in C# so I can fully make everything I want without multiple tedious workarounds. I will keep this up and maintain it so it doesn't break on lethal company updates, but I won't be adding new features most likely.

## Installation
1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/memespost06/Lethal-Hotkeys/releases/latest)
2. Launch LethalHotkeys.exe (Runs in windows tray)
3. Open Lethal Company

## Mod Compatibility
Most mods should work fine, and the mods that won't work most likely need a keybind edit in config to get working. There are too many mods to make a full list, but here are some I know for a fact.

<ins>Not Sure</ins><br>
https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FutureSavior/Hold_Scan_Button/ doesn't have any changes as I already added this feature in the macro. Just to be safe I recommend disabling this mod, even though ive tested it and nothing happened.<br>
